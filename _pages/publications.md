- On the Interpretation of the Intergenerational Elasticity and the Rank-Rank Coefficients for Cross Country Comparison (R&R Economics letters) [PDF]({{'/assets/pdf/IGE_interpetation.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})<details>**Abstract:** This paper investigates the Intergenerational Elasticity (IGE) and Rank-Rank coefficients, employing Yitzhaki's theorem (Yitzhaki, 1996) to express them as weighted averages of underlying causal mechanisms driving mobility. We highlight the challenges of interpreting cross-country comparisons using either the IGE or the Rank-Rank coefficient due to the regression weighting scheme and show that while the Rank-Rank coefficient is more interpretable for positional mobility, it lacks insights into the underlying mechanisms driving mobility across countries. The analysis demonstrates potential drawbacks of using linear regression coefficients as summary statistics in the context of intergenerational mobility comparisons.</details>
- Uncovering Latent Types in Sequential Choice Data Using Text Embedding Algorithm [PDF]({{ '/assets/pdf/word2vec_paper.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})<details>**Abstract:** In economic analyses of agents making a series of discrete choices, deciding what constitutes an alternative is crucial. This paper introduces a technique for categorizing similar alternatives in contexts where forward-looking agents make a series of decisions. The proposed method groups options that are equivalent from the perspective of the agents, using the renowned
word2vec algorithm (Mikolov et al., 2013b, Mikolov et al., 2013a) from the Natural Language Processing literature. The paper discusses the link between the word2vec method and the underlying dynamic optimization problem of the agent.</details>
- A Note on Linear Regression in a Nonlinear World: The Multivariate Case [PDF]({{ '/assets/pdf/yitzhakiMultivarite05272023.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}) [Python Example](/assets/notebooks/GeneralizedYitzhakiExamples.ipynb) <details>**Abstract:** This note employs a multivariate version of Yitzhaki's theorem (1996) to interpret the coefficients of a continuous treatment variable in a regression model with controls, when the data-generating process is not linear. We show that the coefficient does not usually capture a weighted average of treatment effects, mainly due to biases akin to omitted variable and attenuation biases.</details> 

##### Work in Progress
- Cost of Uncertainty over the Life Cycle [Slides]({{ '/assets/pdf/lifeCycleUncertainty_slides.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}) <details> **Abstract:** We examine the welfare implications of income uncertainty, specifically its differential impact across social groups. Leveraging a new lifecycle metric for uncertainty costs, we compare utility outcomes from both expected and optimal consumption profiles under certainty. To perform this analysis, we employ a new approach that uses a Generative AI model (Normalized Flow) for the estimation and simulation of future consumption and income trajectories. Utilizing comprehensive household survey data from India, our findings reveal small but persistent disparities in uncertainty costs across different castes, under the assumption of homogeneous utility functions. The study suggests that, in the absence of preference heterogeneity, income-to-welfare mapping may be adequately performed without considering uncertainty. </details>
