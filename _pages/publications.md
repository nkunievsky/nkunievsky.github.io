##### Job Market Paper
- Bridging the Gap: Information, Returns and Choices (Draft coming soon!)<details>**Abstract:** How much of the gap in choices across social groups is driven by differences in returns or the ability to predict these returns? To formalize this question, we use a decomposition exercise and a structural model to quantify the role of information quality and differences in returns in driving this gap. Focusing on the college attendance decisions of white and Hispanic high school students in Texas, we use administrative data to understand what drives their differing choices. We find that the average returns for college for Hispanics are almost zero compared to being positive for whites. We then bound the role of these differences in returns in contributing to the gap in choices. Under our most restrictive assumptions, we find that information can contribute significantly to this gap.We further ask how a policymaker aiming to achieve parity in choices could accomplish this. We find that additional information should have an R-squared between 0.19 and 0.35 in explaining post-college earnings, which is challenging to achieve using standard datasets.</details>

- It’s Not Who You Are, It’s What They Know: Wage Gaps and Informational Frictions [PDF]({{ '/assets/pdf/itsNotWhoYouAre.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}) <details>**Abstract:** Can informational asymmetries among firms account for all observed wage gaps across social groups? We confirm this through a parsimonious common-value auction model in the labor market with unspecified information structures. Firms with identical characteristics encounter workers with unobserved productivity and extend wage offers based on their information about worker productivity and competing offers. Using 2010 American Community Survey data, we show that wage disparities among both black and white men and women can be explained using a common productivity distribution for all social groups and differences in what firms know, if the mean of this common productivity distribution ranges between \$48,000 and \$132,800. Our results emphasize the importance of understanding what firms know in shaping wage distributions and explaining wage disparities.</details> 
- On the Interpretation of the Intergenerational Elasticity and the Rank-Rank Coefficients for Cross Country Comparison (R&R Economics letters) [PDF]({{'/assets/pdf/IGE_interpetation.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})<details>**Abstract:** This paper investigates the Intergenerational Elasticity (IGE) and Rank-Rank coefficients, employing Yitzhaki's theorem (Yitzhaki, 1996) to express them as weighted averages of underlying causal mechanisms driving mobility. We highlight the challenges of interpreting cross-country comparisons using either the IGE or the Rank-Rank coefficient due to the regression weighting scheme and show that while the Rank-Rank coefficient is more interpretable for positional mobility, it lacks insights into the underlying mechanisms driving mobility across countries. The analysis demonstrates potential drawbacks of using linear regression coefficients as summary statistics in the context of intergenerational mobility comparisons.</details>
- Uncovering Latent Types in Sequential Choice Data Using Text Embedding Algorithm [PDF]({{ '/assets/pdf/word2vec_paper.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})<details>**Abstract:** In economic analyses of agents making a series of discrete choices, deciding what constitutes an alternative is crucial. This paper introduces a technique for categorizing similar alternatives in contexts where forward-looking agents make a series of decisions. The proposed method groups options that are equivalent from the perspective of the agents, using the renowned
word2vec algorithm (Mikolov et al., 2013b, Mikolov et al., 2013a) from the Natural Language Processing literature. The paper discusses the link between the word2vec method and the underlying dynamic optimization problem of the agent.</details>
- A Note on Linear Regression in a Nonlinear World: The Multivariate Case [PDF]({{ '/assets/pdf/YitzhakiNote.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}) [Python Example](/assets/notebooks/GeneralizedYitzhakiExamples.ipynb) <details>**Abstract:** This note employs a multivariate version of Yitzhaki's theorem (1996) to interpret the coefficients of a continuous treatment variable in a regression model with controls, when the data-generating process is not linear. We show that the coefficient does not usually capture a weighted average of treatment effects, mainly due to biases akin to omitted variable and attenuation biases.</details>

- Quantifying Uncertainty over the Lifecycle [Slides]({{ '/assets/pdf/lifeCycleUncertainty_slides.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}) <details> **Abstract:** We examine the welfare implications of income uncertainty, specifically its differential impact across social groups. Leveraging a new lifecycle metric for uncertainty costs, we compare utility outcomes from both expected and optimal consumption profiles under certainty. To perform this analysis, we employ a new approach that uses a Generative AI model (Normalized Flow) for the estimation and simulation of future consumption and income trajectories. Utilizing comprehensive household survey data from India, our findings reveal small but persistent disparities in uncertainty costs across different castes, under the assumption of homogeneous utility functions. The study suggests that, in the absence of preference heterogeneity, income-to-welfare mapping may be adequately performed without considering uncertainty. </details>
