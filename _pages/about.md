hi.

I’m a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Knowledge Lab at the University of Chicago, where I focus on the Science of Science under the supervision of Prof. James Evans. I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Chicago.  

My research interests include the Science of Science, Applied Econometrics, and Labor Economics.  

Before joining the University of Chicago, I completed my Master’s in Economics at Tel Aviv University and worked as a research assistant at the Hebrew University and the Research Department of the Bank of Israel.  

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
