hi. 

**Iâ€™m on the 2023-2024 Job Market.**

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Chicago Department of Economics. 

My primary interests lie in Labor Economics and Applied Econometrics, specifically focusing on the intersection of choice and information. 

Before joining the University of Chicago, I received a Masters in Economics from Tel-Aviv University and worked as a research assistant at The Hebrew University and The Research Department of the Bank of Israel.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
