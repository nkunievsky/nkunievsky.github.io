hi.

I’m a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Knowledge Lab at the University of Chicago, where I focus on the Science of Science under the supervision of Prof. James Evans. I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Chicago.  

My research interests include the Science of Science, Applied Econometrics, and Labor Economics.  

Before joining the University of Chicago, I completed my Master’s in Economics at Tel Aviv University and worked as a research assistant at the Hebrew University and the Research Department of the Bank of Israel.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
